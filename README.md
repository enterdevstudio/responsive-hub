# ResponsiveHub

JavaScript goodies for Responsive Design

## Browser Compatibility

* IE 7+
* Firefox 3.6+
* Chrome 4+
* Safari 5+
* Opera 10.10+

Note: Be aware that browsers that does not support media query will not
trigger events of layout change.

## Dependencies

* [jQuery](http://jquery.com) 1.4.4 + (..., 1.7.2, 1.8.2)
* [Modernizr MediaQueries](http://modernizr.com/) 2.6.2
  (We only need media queries verification, we have a [custom
build](https://github.com/globocom/responsive-hub/blob/master/lib/modernizr_mediaqueries.js) in
lib directory in case you do not have modernizr in your project)

## Usage

### Initialization

The first thing to do is define what resolutions your web app can
handle:

````javascript
// After the document loads
$(function() {
  $.responsiveHub({
    layouts: {
      320:  "phone",
      960:  "tablet",
      1024: "web"
    },
    defaultLayout: "web"
  });
});

````

**Important:** This code should be the last script to run.

Here, our web app supports three distinct resolutions, or layouts:
*phone*, *tablet*, and *web*. The key associated to each value is the
corresponding minimum screen width, in pixels, which ResponsiveHub uses
to determine how to call each screen range.

To make things easier to visualize, in this particular example, these
are the ranges:

1. Window width >= 1024 is called *web*
2. Window width >= 960 and < 1024 is called *tablet*
3. Window width >= 320 and < 960 is called *phone*

Another interesting parameter is the `defaultLayout`; it is the layout
used when the browser doesn't support media queries.

#### Initialization Callback

If you are interested to know when the ResponsiveHub is ready, you can
use the `ready` callback:

````javascript
$.responsiveHub("ready", ["phone", "tablet", "web"], function(event) {
  alert(event.layout); // Current layout
  alert(event.touch);  // Whether the browser supports touch events
});
````

As you can see, the `event` parameter exposes what is the current
layout and whether the device is touch-enabled.

This callback is useful when you need to do further adjustments before
the page is fully ready, i.e., re-initialize a pagination plugin with a
different number of elements per page.

The second parameter indicates what layouts you are interested to be
notified about. For example, if you just need to change things for
relatively small screen sizes (like phones), this is what you need:

````javascript
$.responsiveHub("ready", "phone", function(event) {
  // This will not be called for bigger screen sizes
});
````

**Important:** Just remember that you must declare the callback
*before* the initialization shown before runs. Otherwise, it would
be too late.

### Listening To Resolution Changes

Another common need in responsive-enabled web apps is to know when the
user changes from one layout to another in order to adjust something
that cannot be done entirely via CSS.

ResponsiveHub provides a callback just for that:

````javascript
$.responsiveHub("change", "phone", function(event) {
  // Do something radical when the user switches to phone layout
});

$.responsiveHub("change", ["tablet", "web"], function(event) {
  // Restore things when the user goes back to more sane layouts :-)
});
````

### Window Resize Start/Stop Events

Sometimes it's useful to know when the user initiates a resize
gesture. Since the Window object doesn't provide a simple way to do
that, ResponsiveHub implements the following callbacks:

````javascript
$.responsiveHub("resizeStart", function() {
  // Called when the user initiates a resize gesture
});

$.responsiveHub("resizeStop", function() {
  // Called when the user finishes the resize gesture
});
````

To know if a resize gesture is happening at any moment:

````javascript
$.responsiveHub("isResizing"); // true or false
````

### Standalone Functions

If you need to check some properties of the browser at any moment,
there's a few functions you can use.

#### Get Current Layout

Returns the layout corresponding to the current window size:

````javascript
$.responsiveHub("layout"); // "tablet"
````

#### Adobe Flash Support

Returns whether the browser has Flash support enabled:

````javascript
$.responsiveHub("hasFlash"); // true or false
````

#### Touch Support

Returns whether the browser supports touch gestures:

````javascript
$.responsiveHub("isTouch"); // true or false
````

## Testing with jasmine

ResponsiveHub comes with some helpers to support your tests.
To install includes the file **src/responsive_hub.jasmine_helpers.js**
and do something like:

```javascript
beforeEach(function() {
  window.helpers = (function() {
    return {
      responsiveHub: $.responsiveHub.jasmineHelpers
    }
  })();
});
```

### Helpers

#### setLayout

```javascript
it("should something...", function() {
  helpers.responsiveHub.setLayout("phone");
  // ...
});
```

#### setTouch

```javascript
it("should something...", function() {
  helpers.responsiveHub.setTouch(true);
  // ...
});
```

#### hasFlash

```javascript
it("should something...", function() {
  helpers.responsiveHub.hasFlash(false);
  // ...
});
```

#### setWidth

```javascript
it("should something...", function() {
  helpers.responsiveHub.setWidth(800);
  // ...
});
```

#### setWindow

```javascript
it("should something...", function() {
  helpers.responsiveHub.setWindow(win);
  // ...
});
```

#### triggerChangeToLayout

```javascript
it("should something...", function() {
  var callback = jasmine.createSpy("onChange");
  $.responsiveHub("change", ["phone", "tablet"], callback);

  helpers.responsiveHub.triggerChangeToLayout("phone");
  expect(callback).toHaveBeenCalledWith({layout: "phone", touch: false});
  // ...
});
```

#### getLayoutWidth

```javascript
it("should something...", function() {
  expect(helpers.responsiveHub.getLayoutWidth("web")).toBe(960);
  // ...
});
```
